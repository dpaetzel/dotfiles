  - mainly 4.2 since we are *generating* f=f
  - kinds of lines
    - flowed line: ends in a space
    - fixed: does not end in a space
    - "-- ": signature separator
  - f=f message
    - \geq 0 paragraphs that
    - contain \geq 1 flowed line followed by
    - 1 fixed line
    - usual: series of flowed lines with empty fixed lines between them
  - soft line breaks: SPACE CLRF
    - technique 1: RFC 2464, simply break after ASCII spaces, however must set
      delsp to no
    - technique 2: more sophisticated, esp. useful when there are few ASCII
      spaces, however must set delsp to yes
  - generating f=f
    - \leq 78 line length (including spaces)
      - perhaps: 66 line length for those not capable of interpreting f=f
    - trim spaces before user-inserted hard line breaks
    - prefix lines with spaces whose text starts with a space, "From ", or ">"
      (space-stuffing)
    - "-- " line only if signature separator (be careful when rewrapping)
    - quote lines start with ">* *" (*no spaces between the ">"* as these space
      stuff the next ">"!)
  - important: OpenPGP is discouraged with f=f, use OpenPGP-MIME instead!
    - ~smime_is_default = yes~
