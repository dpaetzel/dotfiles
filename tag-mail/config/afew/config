# If the new message has been added to a thread that has already been tagged
# killed then add the killed tag to this message. This allows for ignoring all
# replies to a particular thread.

# This filter looks for the List-Id header, and if it finds it, adds a tag lists
# and a tag named lists/<list-id>.

# It extends SentMailsFilter with the following feature: Emails filtered by this
# filter have the new tag removed, so will not have the inbox tag added by the
# InboxFilter.
[ArchiveSentMailsFilter]
# This looks at which folder each email is in and uses that name as a tag for
# the email.
# [FolderNameFilter] # not needed since we do only pull All Mail etc.
# This removes the new tag, and adds the inbox tag, to any message that isnâ€™t
# killed or spam.
